# Human Resources Data Analysis
1. Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a Human Resources dataset, aiming to uncover meaningful insights into workforce dynamics. The analysis leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process, visualize, and interpret the data.

2. Objectives
Key areas of focus include:
Employee Income Distribution: Exploring salary variations across different roles and departments.
Job Satisfaction Levels: Understanding how satisfied employees are in their current roles.
Annual Hiring Trends: Analyzing patterns in employee recruitment over the years.
Attrition Rates: Examining factors that contribute to employee turnover.

3. Methodology
    Data Cleaning & Preparation: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and standardized categorical variables.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed statistical summaries and visual inspections to identify trends and anomalies.
    Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create clear, informative charts, including histograms, bar plots, and trend lines.

4. Tools & Technologies
Python – Core analysis and computation
Pandas – Data manipulation and transformation
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis environment
